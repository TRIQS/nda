## Version 1.1.0

nda is a C++ library providing an efficient and flexible multi-dimensional array class.
It is an essential building-block of the TRIQS project. Some features include
* coded in C++20 using concepts
* expressions are implemented lazily for maximum performance
* flexible and lightweight view-types
* matrix and vector class with BLAS / LAPACK backend
* easily store and retrieve arrays to and from hdf5 files using [h5](https://github.com/TRIQS/h5)
* common mpi functionality using [mpi](https://github.com/TRIQS/mpi)

This is the initial release for this project.
